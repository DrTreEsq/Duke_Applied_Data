<h2> Plotting Exercise: Excel </h2>

<p> To get started visualizing data, we wanted to make sure that you had the opportunity to use some tools that you’re likely already familiar with before we move on to data visualization tools with steeper learning curves. Over the course of this class, we’ll be doing similar assignments with each of the data visualization tools we expose you to, so that you can get a feeling of what it’s like to do similar actions across different tools, and eventually be able to pick the right data visualization tool for your projects moving forward. Using Excel may feel comfortable for most of us, but it’s also a reasonably powerful tool. In each of these assignments, we’ll give you a list of Pros and Cons of each of these tools, to hopefully illustrate motivations for using them or things that may complicate your future workflows. As Excel and Google Sheets are very similar environments, you’ll find that our proposed list of pros and cons are the same for these two tools. </p>

Pros:

* Familiar and widely used spreadsheet tools with a user-friendly interface.

* Suitable for small datasets and quick data exploration.

* Offers a wide range of built-in functions for data manipulation and analysis.

* Supports basic charting and visualization capabilities.

Cons:

* Limited scalability for large datasets and complex analyses.

* Less flexible in terms of customization and advanced statistical visualizations.

* May require manual steps for repetitive tasks, leading to potential errors.

<h4> Instructions </h4>

For each these plotting exercises throughout the course, we’ll usually be following the same set of goals. In each of these plotting assignments you will need to do the following objectives:

* Load the Alta data.

* Plot a histogram of snow depth

* Plot a scatter plot of snow fall with respect to temperature

* Plot a line for each of the following:

** Minimum temperature

** Observation temperature

** Maximum temperature

Reflection

These assignments are not graded, but they’re important to help you understand each of these different data visualization tools. We’d encourage you to post about your experience using this 
week’s plotting discussion prompt
. What did you find interesting about visualizing your data in this environment? What was difficult, and what felt better than other visualization environments we’ve used in this course?
