<h4> Getting Your System Ready </h4>

In this course you will be running all the examples and exercises locally on your machine. Consequently, you will need to have an internet browser, an HTML editor, and a web server installed on your machine. Throughout this course we are going to use 
Chrome as our internet browser,  
Brackets as our HTML editor and the 
Web Server for Chrome App as our web server. All of these are free and are available for various platforms including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. Below, we will go over the installation process of each of these. Of course, you are welcome to use any software that you like, but we recommend that you install the above so that it is easier for you to follow along. 

Chrome

To install the Chrome browser, simply visit the 
Chrome home page
. 


Click the blue "Download Chrome" button to download the installation file to your machine.


Install Chrome on Mac

Open the file called googlechrome.dmg.
In the window that opens, find Chrome .
Drag Chrome to the Applications folder.
Open Chrome.
Open Finder.
In the sidebar, to the right of Google Chrome, click Eject.
Install Chrome on Linux

Use the same software that installs programs on your computer to install Chrome. You'll be asked to enter the administrator account password.

To open the package, click OK.
Click Install Package.
Google Chrome will be added to your software manager so it stays up-to-date.

NOTE: It is very important that you use the latest version of Chrome in order for the exercises to run. So make sure you have the latest version of Chrome installed. The current latest version is: 78.0.3904.108. 


Web Server for Chrome

To install the Web Server for Chrome App go to the 
Web Server for Chrome App
 page in the chrome web store. 


Click on the blue "Add to Chrome" button on the upper right-hand corner. The app will automatically be added to your Chrome Browser. You can find it under the Chrome Apps. Type chrome://apps/ into Google Chrome to pull up your Chrome Apps.



Brackets

To install the Brackets, simply visit the 
Brackets home page
. 


Click on the blue "Download Brackets" button to download the installation file to your machine.

Note: On September 1, 2021, Adobe will end support for Brackets so you might not be able to find the downloadable binaries (Download Brackets button) directly on their website. You can still find them in their 
Github repo releases section
. 


For Mac, v1.14.2 download link can be found 
here
.

That's it! You should now be all setup to follow along. 


<h4> Downloading the Ungraded Labs and Programming Assignments </h4>
<p> Like we mentioned earlier, in this course you will be running all the coding examples and exercises locally on your machine. We have created this 
GitHub Repository where you can find all the ungraded labs and programming assignments not only for this course but for the entire TensorFlow for Data and Deployment Specialization.</p

<p> You can download all the ungraded labs and programming assignments to your computer by cloning or downloading the GitHub Repository.</p>





<p> You can find the corresponding ungraded labs and programming assingments for this course in the following folder in the GitHub repository:</p>



* https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/tensorflow-2-public/tree/main/C1_Browser-based-TF-JS





<p> Each folder contains the corresponding ungraded labs and programming assignments for each week of this course. </p>

###### NOTE: The code in the repository is updated occasionally. Therefore the code in the repository may vary slightly from the one shown in the videos. 


<h4> Getting Ready: Accessing Microsoft Excel </h4>

In data visualization, it's easy to get carried away with cutting-edge tools and techniques, but let's not overlook the timeless foundationâ€”Excel. While we may be well-versed in its functionalities, it remains a fundamental asset in our toolkit. Excel's familiar interface and robust data manipulation capabilities provide a sturdy starting point for any data visualization project, allowing us to efficiently structure, clean, and analyze data before diving into more advanced visualization methods. As we explore innovative approaches, let's remember to pay homage to this versatile workhorse that continues to underpin our data visualization endeavors.

If you have a Microsoft 365 subscription, Microsoft Excel is available as part of the Microsoft Office suite. If you don't have a Microsoft 365 subscription or need to install Excel from another source (like a product key or installer file), you can follow these steps to 
download and install or reinstall Microsoft 365 or Office 2021 on a PC or Mac
.

Note: If you are a student or educator, you may be eligible for special offers or discounts through your educational institution. Additionally, some computers may come with pre-installed versions of Microsoft Office, which may include Excel. Be sure to check for any available options before purchasing or downloading Excel separately.
