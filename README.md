Getting Your System Ready

In this course you will be running all the examples and exercises locally on your machine. Consequently, you will need to have an internet browser, an HTML editor, and a web server installed on your machine. Throughout this course we are going to use 
Chrome
 as our internet browser,  
Brackets
 as our HTML editor and the 
Web Server for Chrome App
 as our web server. All of these are free and are available for various platforms including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. Below, we will go over the installation process of each of these. Of course, you are welcome to use any software that you like, but we recommend that you install the above so that it is easier for you to follow along.

<h4> Downloading the Ungraded Labs and Programming Assignments </h4>
<p> Like we mentioned earlier, in this course you will be running all the coding examples and exercises locally on your machine. We have created this 
GitHub Repository where you can find all the ungraded labs and programming assignments not only for this course but for the entire TensorFlow for Data and Deployment Specialization.</p

<p> You can download all the ungraded labs and programming assignments to your computer by cloning or downloading the GitHub Repository.</p>





<p> You can find the corresponding ungraded labs and programming assingments for this course in the following folder in the GitHub repository:</p>



* https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/tensorflow-2-public/tree/main/C1_Browser-based-TF-JS





<p> Each folder contains the corresponding ungraded labs and programming assignments for each week of this course. </p>
